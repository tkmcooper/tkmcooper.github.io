      <p>
        Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivalled humility, Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the <a href="https://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. Michael is also notorious as the founder of <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and the <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau Manifesto</em></a>, but rumours that he's secretly a supervillain are slightly exaggerated.

        When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

      <p>
        You may have seen him shredding guitar live Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is his kitchen table.
